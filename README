To populate the popup menu, put .desktop files into ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch/

= INSTALL =

2. create ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch and put a few .desktop files in there

  mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/quicklaunch/

3. reload gnome-shell (press alt-f2, enter r)

4. use gnome-tweak-tool to enable the new shell extension
